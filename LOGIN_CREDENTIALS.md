# Login Credentials

## Ready to Use

You can log in immediately with these credentials:

```
Email:    admin@cohortsync.local
Password: Admin123!
Role:     Admin (full access)
```

## What You Can Do

Once logged in, you'll have access to:

- **Admin Dashboard** - Manage users, content, and platform settings
- **User Management** - View and moderate all users
- **Content Management** - Manage posts, announcements, and resources
- **Analytics** - View platform statistics
- **Community Features** - Access all member features (directory, messages, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing "Invalid credentials" error?

1. Make sure you're typing the credentials exactly as shown above
2. Clear your browser cache and local storage:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application > Local Storage
   - Clear all items
   - Refresh the page

### Redirected immediately after login?

This is normal! The app will redirect you to the homepage after successful login.

### Want to use your original account (shubham@gmail.com)?

You'll need to reset the password first. See `AUTHENTICATION_STATUS.md` for detailed instructions.

## Next Steps

1. Go to the login page
2. Enter the credentials above
3. Start exploring the platform!

The app now properly:
- Requires authentication before showing content
- Redirects to login when not authenticated
- Shows a loading state while checking auth
- Maintains your session across page refreshes
